I am pretty bad at math but coding helps me wrap my mind around problem solving and gives me a source of steps I can refer back to so I thought I would create a math and unit library for things I regularly use to shape up. Hence this libraryâ€™s name for Victory over math and to help me with victory in other projects. This project is not intended for public use; it is being publicly hosted for convenience sake in case I need to ask a question about a particular problem within. 

The project will stick with my narrowest path principle* in that a completed solution is not necessarily one that covers all potential problems/solutions from every angle but one that provides a direct, achievable solution to the problem at hand. Case in point the only angle unit this library supports is radians because most math operations require radians, degrees are a nice to have but not necessary. Another case in point is that rather than supporting generics the code support a single underlying datatype for each unit to reduce the amount of coding; and you might think that would increase the amount of coding but as was the case with angles other unit that would be nice to have can be dropped. So one unit and one data type per problem, no need to fuss with generics because a chunk of code will not be repeated.

*I was told growing up a narrow path through the woods was worth more than an unfinished highway halfway through.
